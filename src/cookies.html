  ## Cookie Policy

  This Cookie Policy explains how BoulderRyn uses cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our website at **boulderryn.co.uk**. It explains what these technologies are, why we use them, and your rights to control their use.

  ### What are cookies?

  Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit a website. They help websites work more efficiently and can provide information to site owners about how the site is being used.

  Cookies can be "session" cookies (which expire when you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (which stay on your device for a set period or until deleted).

  ### Why we use cookies

  We use cookies for a few key reasons:

  - **Essential cookies**: These are needed to make the website function properly. You can't turn these off.
  - **Analytics cookies**: These help us understand how people use the site, so we can improve things.
  - **Functionality cookies**: These remember choices you’ve made (like your preferences or login), so you don’t have to keep re-entering them.
  - **Third-party cookies**: Some of our pages may include content or features from third parties (like embedded maps or videos), which may set their own cookies.

  ### Cookies we use

  Here are the main cookies you might encounter on our site:

  - `_ga`, `_gid`: Set by Google Analytics. These help us understand how people use the site. No personally identifiable data is collected.
  - `cookieConsent`: Remembers if you’ve accepted cookies.

  We may update this list from time to time as we add or remove tools.

  ### Managing your cookie preferences

  You can usually manage cookies through your browser settings. You can:

  - Delete all cookies
  - Block certain types of cookies
  - Set your browser to ask before accepting a cookie

  Please note that blocking some cookies may affect how the site functions.
