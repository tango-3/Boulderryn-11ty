  title: Sign Before You Climb
  lead: >
    Before you can get on the wall, we'll need a waiver signed, it only takes a
    minute and covers the key safety stuff.   If it's your first visit, there's
    a **one-time £3 registration fee**.   Bringing little ones? They need to be
    over 5, have a waiver signed by a parent or guardian, and be supervised
    **(one adult per two kids)**.

    Make sure you've watched the video below before signing. If you're unsure
    about anything, feel free to get in touch.

introduction:
  title: >
    What is bouldering - Bouldering is climbing in its purest form: short climbs, soft mats, and endless challenges to keep you coming back.
  lead: >
    Bouldering is a style of climbing done on shorter walls or rock, without ropes or harnesses, with thick mats below for safety. Instead of long climbs, you take on shorter, more technical “problems” - set routes you try to solve from start to finish.
  body: |
    It's as much about balance, movement, and problem-solving as it is about strength, so you don't need to be a seasoned athlete to enjoy it. Routes are graded so there's something for every ability, from complete beginners to experienced climbers.

    Indoors, you'll find colour-coded holds and routes that are changed regularly to keep things fresh. Outdoors, it's about the feel of real rock and the challenge of natural shapes.

    Because there's no ropework involved, bouldering is easy to pick up, sociable, and great for fitting into a busy day - whether you're after a serious training session or just a good excuse to get moving.
