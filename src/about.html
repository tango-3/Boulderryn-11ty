    At BoulderRyn, we've created a space that brings people together, whether
    you're here to hit the wall hard, hang out, or just try something new.

    Jules and Guy have travelled most of their lives, both sharing a love of the
    outdoors.
  body: >
    Guy has spent the last decade being a stunt rigger on major Hollywood films,
    but climbing has always been a lifelong passion. 


    Jules has been a teacher in the local community for 20 years.


    Combining Guy's passion for climbing and Jules's passion for working with the community, the idea of BoulderRyn was born.


    Our mission is to enable and inspire the community: 'climb indoors to climb outdoors'.
